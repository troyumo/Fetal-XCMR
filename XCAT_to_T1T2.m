% T1 and T2 values are stored in a table with the format:
% [T1 @ 1.5 T, T2 @ 1.5 T, T1 @ 3.0 T, T2 @ 3.0 T]
% Note the current implimentation is for 1.5T

% Relaxation values are based off of:
% Stanisz GJ, Odrobina EE, Pun J, Escaravage M, Graham SJ, Bronskill MJ, Henkelman RM. T1, T2 relaxation and magnetization transfer in tissue at 3T. Magnetic resonance in medicine. 2005;54:507–12.
